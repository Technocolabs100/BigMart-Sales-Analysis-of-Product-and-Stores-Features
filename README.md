# BigMart-Sales-Analysis-of-Product-and-Stores-Features

## Here's my task for BigMart (Mini Project)

- [Mini Project](https://github.com/hossama7med8666/BigMart-Sales-Analysis-of-Product-and-Stores-Features/blob/main/BigMart%20code.ipynb):

In this project, I first scrutinized the data, addressed missing values, conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights, 
and created informative visualizations. Subsequently, 
I developed machine learning models, optimizing their performance using grid search to determine the best parameters for each model.
